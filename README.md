Hello and welcome to my GitHub.

I’m Sanskruti Sakharkar, currently studying for a Master of Information Technology at the University of Waikato. I'm passionate about using technology to solve meaningful problems, and this space is where I share some of the projects I’ve built along the way.

My work focuses on full-stack development, cloud-native applications, and AI-driven tools. I enjoy exploring how different technologies come together to create practical, user-focused solutions.

Some of the projects I’ve worked on include:

PrepSmart – an AI-based interview feedback tool using voice input, NLP, and resume-job analysis

DonateMate – a real-time donation platform with integrated payments and NGO dashboards

Cloud Footprint Analyzer – a secure serverless app that helps users understand their digital data trail

I’m always keen to learn and take on new challenges—especially in areas like software engineering, cloud architecture, and applied AI.
